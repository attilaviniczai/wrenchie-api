Wrenchie Mechanics is an imaginary car repair and maintenance service company
located in Greenfield Republic.
With an employee count of 40 across 4 service centers
it is a mid-sized company by greenfieldian standards.
The company has started a web application development project
sparked by the results of a recent investigation into profitability.

Wrenchie Mechanics profit has been declining since the end of 2008.
Profit has been negative since the end of 2018.
Currently the future of the company is at stake.

At the end of 2020 Wrenchie Mechanics has launched an investigation on
why the company is "falling behind the curve",
as indicated by a continuous loss of profit.
This investigation revealed that competition offerings are
more favourable to potential customers.
The cause likely being each competitor having a modern customer-facing web application.
On this discovery an action plan was formed: Wrenchie Mechanics
must have a modern web application for their customer base as soon as possible.
